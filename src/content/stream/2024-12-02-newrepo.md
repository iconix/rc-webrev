omg! TIL that *when i have a local repository, vscode can handle publishing it to github*!! so i don't have to separately create a new repo in the github ui, then set the remote origin etc etc, before pushing what's local up. phew, i was always so reliant on copy-pasting those commands from the github ui ðŸ˜Œ ([via](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_publish-local-repository-to-github))
