Welcome! I set this new site up with the [Astro 'build a blog' tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/), before striking out on my own to customize it.

Some wise words to live by as I re-enter web-dev-land:
> donâ€™t forget that you can go pretty far with just vanilla JavaScript and CSS!

Thanks, [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/2/).

Curious about [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) though! Will need to strike a balance.
