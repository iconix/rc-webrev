I am wrapping up parental leave and hunting for my next role, feeling professionally reinvigorated and refreshed!

While preparing for my return to work, I am migrating [my old personal site](https://iconix.github.io/) to this new one, building a lil scheduling app for my fam, and battling spring allergies ðŸ¤§
