üéÆ This week has been thoroughly gamedev-themed! I dusted off my "Impossible Stuff Day" repo [from week 3](/blog/2024/11/rc-reflection-2), joined the game dev interest group, sketched out a map of my small town, and started another tutorial: all towards slowly, but surely, developing the game interface that I envision for this site. I am embracing being a beginner all over again! Check out my [stream](/stream) for a couple sneak peeks into the process so far! (A new thought from this reflection: I should keep a dev log on this! Just need to bundle my notes together.)

üçì The day-long pairing jam was a delightful new addition to the batch cycle! Huge thanks to my pairing partners for diving into gameplay modifications (we were thinking: [Vampire Survivors](https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors), in space) on a [demo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/videos/758671/XvxLmEVC/game_running_.mp4) built with React, React-Three-Fiber, and a custom entity component system (ECS) named [Koota](https://github.com/pmndrs/koota) (maintained by one of my pairing partners, Kris). While I was mostly trying to keep up, I achieved my goal of learning a ton about ECS and data-oriented programming.

üìÖ Made my [days left at rc](https://iconix.github.io/rc-daysleft/) visualization from [last week](/blog/2025/01/rc-reflection-5) more flexible - now anyone can edit the underlying JSON config in-browser to track their own meaningful time periods. The site saves edits to localStorage for return visits, or you can save it as HTML for future use. Want to count down to summer? Track a project timeline? It's all easily possible now!

üíº As much as I'd love to keep focusing purely on creative projects, the career services AMA by RC faculty was a well-timed reminder of all the resources available for the next chapter. Came away with concrete next steps and a(nother) gentle nudge to start thinking beyond batch.

ü™´ Had to cancel my planned hub visit due to the daunting prospect of driving up to Brooklyn in the middle of the night after a long workday. It's a bummer, but sometimes all one can do is yield to rest. Working remotely from Maryland definitely adds an extra layer of complexity to hub visits. I still hope to make it up for my last week of batch.
