ü™© And we're back from winter break: happy new year! And welcome to my new Winter 2, 2025 batch-mates.

‚ùÑÔ∏è RC's return coincided with about 6+ inches of snow here on the Maryland side of the DC suburbs - quite a lot for this area nowadays. The trade-off of suburban life versus our old Brooklyn life became crystal clear when I found myself digging out our driveway on Monday evening.

üöº Three (3!!!) snow days in a row for daycare meant lots of unplanned quality time with my 10-month-old! Still getting used to this working + childcare dance. Having flexibility in our schedule is such a blessing, even if I forget that all the time and grow anxious about "productivity." I am looking forward to next Friday's hub visit: we are planning to make a too-quick, weekend trip up to Brooklyn around some family birthdays!

üéØ The mid-batch reflection workshop in December helped me set some goals for this second half of batch: (1) push through the mental barrier I've built up around the next iterations of this site (this will also help with [working at the edge of my abilities](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#work-at-the-edge)); (2) pair more (combines working at the edge of my abilities with interview prep); (3) [blog](/blog) and [stream](/stream) more content; (4) nature of code: redux and keeping up on creative pursuits; (5) next company hunt and practice interviews. Roughly in that order.

üìù Finally published my first project write-up of RC: [batches of batch: visualizing RC interests](/blog/2025/01/rc-batchviz). What was meant to be a "warmup" has turned into much more time and many more words than anticipated, but getting it out there feels like finally clearing out the mental space for new projects.

‚è∞ _The Artist's Way_ morning pages have been an interesting challenge. It turns out that they are meant to be written first thing when you wake up - which is tricky as a night owl with the aforementioned 10-month-old who usually wakes around 7:15am. But I managed my first 25-minute session before he woke up on Friday morning. Now to keep my 1-day streak alive, heading into the weekend...

üìä Put together a small visualization that I am proud of called [days left at rc](https://iconix.github.io/rc-daysleft/). It is a modified version of [Rory Flint's "Day by Day"](https://days.rory.codes/), which was itself inspired by Wait But Why's ["Your Life in Weeks"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) - although I like to think of my version as less morbid and less presumptuous (assuming 85 years of life?! I could get hit by a truck tomorrow). I might update the name to "days left/spent at rc." It attempts to capture this strange relationship with time that I have right now at RC, being hyper-aware of batch's finite nature (as discussed in my [last reflection](/blog/2024/12/rc-reflection-4)). I find myself revisiting the viz in a perpetually open tab, sometimes finding it unnerving, but more often finding it comforting. I plan to write up this micro-project in a slightly longer blog post.

üéÆ Finally took a step to get over the mental block around my main batch project: this site! Started looking at game assets and sketching out what I want the home page to evolve to. I know nothing about developing a game interface like the one that I am imagining. But as Angelou said, ain't nothin' to it but to do it.

üü© Time-blocking has made its return to my daily routine, which helps me stay on track throughout the day (even if forever behind on the actual timings). The idea of refreshing [my family app for time-blocking](https://github.com/iconix/fortudo) has re-emerged, sparked by discussions of [home-cooked apps](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) and [software](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software) this week. There's something wonderfully cozy and empowering about building tools for yourself and your community. I just might not have the time to return to this particular well this batch!
